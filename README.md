# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a **Credit Card Fraud Detection system** using both **supervised and unsupervised machine learning models**. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and real-time fraud detection simulation.

---

## Features

- Data preprocessing with **scaling and feature selection**.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand **fraud vs normal transaction distribution**.
- Supervised learning using **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Unsupervised anomaly detection using **Isolation Forest**.
- Real-time transaction risk simulation.
- Visualization of predicted fraudulent transactions.

---

## Dataset

- The project uses the **`creditcard.csv` dataset**, which contains anonymized credit card transactions.
- Features include numerical PCA components (`V1`–`V28`), `Amount`, `Time`, and the target class (`Class`: 0 = Normal, 1 = Fraud).
